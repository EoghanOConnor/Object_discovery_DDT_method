Unsupervised Object Discovery and Co-Localization by Deep Descriptor Transforming
Description:<br>
Using the Deep Descriptor Transforming (DDT) Technique to perform object co-localisation described in the following paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06397.pdf). <br>
The object localisation task involves finding the location of the primary object in an image (same object as image classification result). <br>
In the object co-localisation task the goal is to find the objects in images all of the same class.<br>
